abstract = {Abstract Near-Earth magnetic reconnection reconfigures the magnetotail and produces strong plasma flows that transport plasma sheet particles and electromagnetic energy to the inner magnetosphere. An essential element of such a reconfiguration is strong, transient field-aligned currents. These currents, believed to be generated within the plasma sheet and closed at the ionosphere, are responsible for magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling during substorms. We use conjugate measurements from Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) at the plasma sheet boundary (around x ∼− 10RE) and Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) at the equator (around x ∼− 60RE) to explore the potential generation region of these currents. We find a clear correlation between the field-aligned current intensity measured by MMS and the tailward plasma sheet flows measured by ARTEMIS. To better understand the origin of this correlation, we compare spacecraft observations with results from 3-D particle-in-cell simulations of magnetotail reconnection. The comparison reveals that field-aligned currents and plasma flows start, wax, and wane due to the development of a reconnection region between MMS (near-Earth) and ARTEMIS (at lunar distance). A weak correlation between the field-aligned current intensity at MMS and earthward flow magnitudes at ARTEMIS suggests that distant magnetotail reconnection does not significantly contribute to the generation of the observed near-Earth currents. Our findings support the idea that the dominant role of the near-Earth magnetotail reconnection in the field-aligned current generation is likely responsible for their transient nature, whereas more steady distant tail reconnection would support long-term field-aligned current system.}

abstract = {Abstract The magnetotail current sheet carries the current responsible for the largest fraction of the energy storage in the magnetotail, the magnetic energy in the lobes. It is thus inextricably linked with the dynamics and evolution of many magnetospheric phenomena, such as substorms. The magnetotail current sheet structure and stability depend mostly on the kinetic properties of the plasma populating the magnetotail. One of the most underinvestigated properties of this plasma is electron temperature anisotropy, which may contribute a large fraction of the total current. Using observations from five missions in the magnetotail, we examine the electron temperature anisotropy, Te‖/Te⊥, and its potential contribution to the current density, quantified by the firehose parameter (βe‖−βe⊥)/2, across y∈[−20,20]RE and x∈[−100,−10]RE. We find that a significant fraction (>30\%) of all current sheets have an anisotropic electron current density >10\% of the total current. These current sheets form two distinct groups: (1) near-Earth (<30 RE) accompanied by weak plasma flows (<100 km/s) and enhanced equatorial magnetic field (>3 nT) and (2) middle tail (>40 RE) accompanied by fast plasma flows (>300 km/s) and small equatorial magnetic field (≤1 nT). For a significant number of near-Earth current sheets, the anisotropic electron current can be >25\% of the total current density. Our findings suggest that electron temperature anisotropy should be included in current sheet models describing realistic magnetotail structure and dynamics.},

	abstract = {Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental physical process in plasmas whereby stored magnetic energy is converted into heat and kinetic energy of charged particles. Reconnection occurs in many astrophysical plasma environments and in laboratory plasmas. Using very high time resolution measurements, NASA{\textquoteright}s Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) has found direct evidence for electron demagnetization and acceleration at sites along the sunward boundary of Earth{\textquoteright}s magnetosphere where the interplanetary magnetic field reconnects with the terrestrial magnetic field. We have (i) observed the conversion of magnetic energy to particle energy, (ii) measured the electric field and current, which together cause the dissipation of magnetic energy, and (iii) identified the electron population that carries the current as a result of demagnetization and acceleration within the reconnection diffusion/dissipation region.},

abstract = {The presence of whistler mode waves in, and upstream from, the bow shock has been well established by observation. Theoretical descriptions of the mode under solar wind conditions have been relatively meagre, however, and it may not be generally appreciated how readily whistler waves generated in the shock could occupy most of the region ahead of the shock most of the time. Graphic descriptions of phase and group velocities and group velocity directions for typical solar wind parameters are presented by using the cold plasma approximation over all appropriate frequencies and directions with respect to the IMF. The relations of whistler phase and group velocities to observations of a quasi-perpendicular shock crossing by ISEE are illustrated.},

abstract = {Abstract Nonlinear whistler mode wave-particle interaction is one of the processes to generate relativistic electrons in the Earth's outer radiation belt. Applying test particle simulations with a pair of whistler mode chorus emissions, we traced a large number of electrons in various initial conditions along an L = 4.5 magnetic field line to build a set of Green's functions for analyzing evolution of the electron distribution under the chorus emissions. Employing convolution integral for the Green's functions, we track the formation of relativistic electron fluxes from an injected energetic electron through interaction with consecutive chorus emissions. We compare the simulation results among a purely parallel wave model and two oblique wave models with wave normal angles gradually increased from 0º to 20º and 60º.Multiple resonances result in a higher probability of nonlinear trapping. Hence the trapped electrons for the oblique cases are scattered to a wider range of pitch angles than those for the parallel case. Oblique chorus can accelerate 10–30 keV electrons to MeV level rapidly in several wave emission cycles (about ten seconds), which is much faster than that of the parallel wave model. The study shows comprehensive evolutions of electron fluxes interacting with oblique chorus emissions through cyclotron and Landau resonances in the outer radiation belt.}

abstract = {We would like to propose ceasing the derivation and distribution of the AE (Auroral electrojet) index because AE has no physically interpretable meaning and is therefore of no scientific value. Note that the term “AE indices” is different from the term “AE index;” the former includes the AU and AL indices, whereas the latter is just the AE index itself. (See below for the definition of AU and AL.) Since the introduction of the AE indices by Davis and Sugiura [1966], scientists have relied on the indices to monitor the level of geomagnetic disturbance resulting from the auroral electrojets and hence, by proxy, to specify the state of the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. The AE index was defined by the separation between the upper and lower envelopes of the superposed H component plots from auroral-zone magnetic observatories. The upper and lower envelopes were defined as the AU and AL indices, respectively Thus, there is the relationship given by AE = AU - AL.},

abstract = {Abstract We present a statistical analysis of more than 2,400 electrostatic solitary waves interpreted as electron holes (EH) measured aboard at least three Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft in the Earth's magnetotail. The velocities of EHs are estimated using the multispacecraft interferometry. The EH velocities in the plasma rest frame are in the range from just a few km/s, which is much smaller than ion thermal velocity VTi, up to 20,000 km/s, which is comparable to electron thermal velocity VTe. We argue that fast EHs with velocities larger than about 0.1VTe are produced by bump-on-tail instabilities, while slow EHs with velocities below about 0.05VTe can be produced by warm bistream and, probably, Buneman-type instabilities. We show that typically fast and slow EHs do not coexist, indicating that the instabilities producing EHs of different types operate independently. We have identified a gap in the distribution of EH velocities between VTi and 2VTi, which is considered to be the evidence for self-acceleration (Zhou \& Hutchinson, 2018) or ion Landau damping of EHs. Parallel spatial scales and amplitudes of EHs are typically between λD and 10 λD and between 10−3 Te and 0.1 Te, respectively. We show that electrostatic potential amplitudes of EHs are below the threshold of the transverse instability and highly likely restricted by the nonlinear saturation criterion of electron streaming instabilities seeding electron hole formation: , where ϖ = min(γ, 1.5 ωce), where γ is the increment of instabilities seeding EH formation, while ωce is electron cyclotron frequency. The implications of the presented results are discussed.},

	abstract = {In Earth{\textquoteright}s upper atmosphere, the reconnection of magnetic field lines converts latent magnetic energy into the thermal and kinetic energy of plasma flows. But reconnection appears to produce faster flows before midnight compared with after. To find out why, Lotko et al. simulated this energy exchange. Challenging common assumptions about our space weather environment, they conclude that the ionosphere plays an active role when coupled to the magnetosphere in driving the behavior of the magnetotail.Science, this issue p. 184Observed distributions of high-speed plasma flows at distances of 10 to 30 Earth radii (RE) in Earth{\textquoteright}s magnetotail neutral sheet are highly skewed toward the premidnight sector. The flows are a product of the magnetic reconnection process that converts magnetic energy stored in the magnetotail into plasma kinetic and thermal energy. We show, using global numerical simulations, that the electrodynamic interaction between Earth{\textquoteright}s magnetosphere and ionosphere produces an asymmetry consistent with observed distributions in nightside reconnection and plasmasheet flows and in accompanying ionospheric convection. The primary causal agent is the meridional gradient in the ionospheric Hall conductance which, through the Cowling effect, regulates the distribution of electrical currents flowing within and between the ionosphere and magnetotail.},

    abstract = {An overview is given of important properties of spatial and temporal intermittency, including evidence of its appearance in fluids, magnetofluids and plasmas, and its implications for understanding of heliospheric plasmas. Spatial intermittency is generally associated with formation of sharp gradients and coherent structures. The basic physics of structure generation is ideal, but when dissipation is present it is usually concentrated in regions of strong gradients. This essential feature of spatial intermittency in fluids has been shown recently to carry over to the realm of kinetic plasma, where the dissipation function is not known from first principles. Spatial structures produced in intermittent plasma influence dissipation, heating, and transport and acceleration of charged particles. Temporal intermittency can give rise to very long time correlations or a delayed approach to steady-state conditions, and has been associated with inverse cascade or quasi-inverse cascade systems, with possible implications for heliospheric prediction.},

abstract="Steady-state two-dimensional thin current sheets (TCSs) in collisionless space plasma, similar to the current sheet of the near-Earth magnetotail, are considered. The magnetic field of the sheet is orthogonal to the current and has a nonzero normal component, the electrons are magnetized, and the ions are unmagnetized. To solve the problem of kinetic description of electrons in such current sheets in a general form, they are described by the Vlasov equation in the drift approximation, the general solution to which is found in the form of a function of three independent integrals of the system of drift motion equations. An important case is considered in which the electron guiding centers obey a Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution in a stationary electromagnetic field. The obtained results make it possible to create one- and two-dimensional numerical− analytical models of current sheets in which unmagnetized ions are described by the Vlasov equation, which should be solved numerically, whereas the contribution of magnetized electrons is taken into account analytically. To numerically solve the time-independent Vlasov equation, a new method is proposed that allows one to perform the bulk of computations by using graphic processors. On the basis of the new theory, a one-dimensional numerical−analytical model of a steady-state TCS in the near-Earth magnetotail is presented, TCS configurations are calculated, and the role of electrostatic effects and electron pressure anisotropy is analyzed.",

abstract = {Abstract Previous evidence has suggested that either lower band chorus waves or kinetic Alfven waves scatter equatorial kilovolt electrons that propagate to lower altitudes where they precipitate or undergo further low‐altitude scattering to make pulsating auroras. Recently, time domain structures (TDSs) were shown, both theoretically and experimentally, to efficiently scatter equatorial electrons. To assess the relative importance of these three mechanisms for production of pulsating auroras, 11 intervals of equatorial THEMIS data and a 4 h interval of Van Allen Probe measurements have been analyzed. During these events, lower band chorus waves produced only negligible modifications of the equatorial electron distributions. During the several TDS events, the equatorial 0.1–3 keV electrons became magnetic field‐aligned. Kinetic Alfven waves may also have had a small electron scattering effect. The conclusion of these studies is that time domain structures caused the most important equatorial scattering of ~1 keV electrons toward the loss cone to provide the main electron contribution to pulsating auroras. Chorus wave scattering may have provided part of the highest energy (>10 keV) electrons in such auroras.}

We agree that chorus can scatter electrons >10 keV, as do Time Domain Structures (TDSs). Lower‐energy electrons occurring in pulsating auroras cannot be produced by chorus, but such electrons are scattered and accelerated by TDS. TDSs often occur with chorus and have power in their spectra at chorus frequencies. Thus, the absence of power at low frequencies is not evidence that TDSs are absent, as an example shows. Through examination of equatorial electric field waveforms and electron pitch angle distributions measured on the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms satellites (in place of examining field and particle spectra, as done by Nishimura et al.), we show that chorus cannot produce the field‐aligned electrons associated with pulsating auroras in the Nishimura et al. (2010, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1193186) events, but TDSs can. Equatorial field‐aligned electron distributions associated with pulsating auroras and created by TDS in the absence of chorus or any other wave at the equator are also shown.}

abstract = {Abstract Ultralow Frequency (ULF) waves are electromagnetic pulsations observed throughout the magnetosphere driven by processes both external and internal to the magnetosphere. Within the magnetosphere, discrete and broadband ULF wave activity can couple to the local plasma via coherent or stochastic wave-particle interactions. These wave-particle interactions can lead to dynamic changes in local plasma including rapid acceleration and transport of radiation belt electrons. Using observations from GOES-15 and the Automated Flare Inference of Oscillations algorithm we investigate the distribution and occurrence of broadband and discrete ULF waves to help understand the relative importance of coherent and stochastic wave-particle interactions. We find that intervals of discrete ULF waves are more commonly identified during slow and low-density solar wind, and when Bz is near zero. Broadband waves are more commonly identified during periods of active solar wind, including periods of high solar wind speeds and large density perturbations, and large negative Bz. We also find that under all solar wind conditions the number of intervals of broadband ULF wave power exceed that of discrete wave power, e.g., ULF wave activity is more likely to be broadband. These results suggest that radial diffusion due to incoherent broadband waves is an important driver of wave-particle interactions, especially during active solar wind conditions. However, the presence of discrete waves during both active and quiet solar wind conditions suggests that these waves and the corresponding wave-particle interactions cannot be ignored, especially since discrete wave-particle interactions tend to be more efficient than radial diffusion.}

Adiabatic invariants are approximate first integrals for such dynamics. The existence of adiabatic invariants makes dynamics close to regular. Destruction of adiabatic invariance leads to chaotic dynamics. We present a review of some mechanisms of destruction of adiabatic invariance in slow–fast Hamiltonian systems with examples from charged particle dynamics.}

abstract = {Abstract Mozer et al. (2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA024223) suggested that time domain structures (TDSs) drive pulsating aurora (with additional contributions by kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs)) and that chorus waves have negligible effects. In this comment, we point out that electrons scattered by TDS or KAW (dominantly at ~0.1–3 keV, <1 s modulation) cannot explain key features of pulsating aurora, which require precipitation above a few keV with a couple of tens of second modulation. Their study did not conduct quantitative evaluations of wave‐aurora correlation. The use of short burst mode data (~<10 s) may only cover a single pulse of pulsating aurora and is not suitable for examining connections to pulsating aurora. “Field‐aligned” electrons do not necessarily represent loss cone population, and their characteristic energy (hundreds of eV) is much lower than typical precipitation over pulsating aurora. By reexamining the events studied by Mozer et al., we quantitatively demonstrate that TDS and KAW are uncorrelated with pulsating aurora and that only chorus waves showed high correlations with pulsating aurora. Occasional simultaneous occurrence of TDS/KAW and pulsating aurora is found to be coincidental, because the correlation over a time scale of minutes is poor. Several auroral features analyzed in that paper are not pulsating aurora but other types of aurora. We also show that the chorus‐pulsating aurora correlation can last for 2 h or longer and can be used to highlight dynamic changes in magnetic field mapping. Chorus waves can resonate with electrons above a few keV and are in agreement with pulsating auroral properties.}

The four spacecraft of NASA{\textquoteright}s Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission have repeatedly flown in formation through the magnetopause, measuring the properties of the plasma and magnetic fields in the region. Russell et al. used MMS measurements to study the magnetopause{\textquoteright}s structure and force balance. They identified small-scale dynamic features that form a complex topology and evidence for magnetic flux ropes at the boundary. The results aid our understanding of Earth{\textquoteright}s space environment and magnetospheres around other planets.Science, this issue p. 960The magnetopause deflects the solar wind plasma and confines Earth{\textquoteright}s magnetic field. We combine measurements made by the four spacecraft of the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission to demonstrate how the plasma and magnetic forces at the boundary affect the interaction between the shocked solar wind and Earth{\textquoteright}s magnetosphere. We compare these forces with the plasma pressure and examine the electron distribution function. We find that the magnetopause has sublayers with thickness comparable to the ion scale. Small pockets of low magnetic field strength, small radius of curvature, and high electric current mark the electron diffusion region. The flow of electrons, parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field, reveals a complex topology with the creation of magnetic ropes at the boundary.},

abstract = {Abstract We present the first direct observations of suprathermal (tens to hundreds of eV) electron acceleration perpendicular to the magnetic field in the topside (900–1,500 km) ionosphere. Based on measurements from the suprathermal electron imager (SEI) onboard the Enhanced Polar Outflow Probe satellite over several months, we identify 30 events (28 in the dayside cusp) of enhanced suprathermal electron fluxes peaking at 90° pitch angles, with energies spanning from tens of eV to 325 eV, the upper limit of the SEI measurement. These events take place with a time duration of the order of 0.1 s, corresponding to a spatial scale of less than 1 km across the magnetic field. They are associated with parallel suprathermal electron bursts and upward currents. The correlation between perpendicular and parallel suprathermal electrons suggests a scenario in which downward bursts and the associated Alfvén waves that drive them provide a free energy source to destabilize plasma waves at electron frequencies, which in turn heat electrons in the perpendicular direction. This is a new energy dissipation process for cusp suprathermal electron precipitation in the topside ionosphere.},

abstract = {Summary Earth's radiation belt electrons exhibit pronounced dynamic variability in response to solar activity and resultant changes in the solar wind. The nonadiabatic variability of radiation belt electrons is primarily caused by energy and momentum transfer during interactions with various magnetospheric waves. This chapter reviews recent advances in both our understanding of the excitation mechanisms and global distribution of all important magnetospheric waves and the modeling of resultant wave–particle interactions that lead to large-scale radial transport, local stochastic acceleration, pitch-angle scattering, and ultimate loss by precipitation into the atmosphere.}

abstract = {Abstract Whistler mode chorus waves are a naturally occurring electromagnetic emission observed in Earth's magnetosphere. Here, for the first time, data from NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission were used to analyze chorus waves in detail, including the calculation of chorus wave normal vectors, k. A case study was examined from a period of substorm activity around the time of a conjunction between the MMS constellation and NASA's Van Allen Probes mission on 07 April 2016. Chorus wave activity was simultaneously observed by all six spacecraft over a broad range of L shells (5.5�<�L�<�8.5), magnetic local time (06:00�<�MLT�<�09:00), and magnetic latitude (-32��<�MLAT�<�-15�), implying a large chorus active region. Eight chorus elements and their substructure were analyzed in detail with MMS. These chorus elements were all lower band and rising tone emissions, right-handed and nearly circularly polarized, and propagating away from the magnetic equator when they were observed at MMS (MLAT~-31�). Most of the elements had �hook�-like signatures on their wave power spectra, characterized by enhanced wave power at flat or falling frequency following the peak, and all the elements exhibited complex and well-organized substructure observed consistently at all four MMS spacecraft at separations up to 70�km (60�km perpendicular and 38�km parallel to the background magnetic field). The waveforms in field-aligned coordinates also demonstrated that these waves were all phase coherent, allowing for the direct calculation of k. Error estimates on calculated k revealed that the plane wave approximation was valid for six of the eight elements and most of the subelements. The wave normal vectors were within 20�30� from the direction antiparallel to the background field for all elements and changed from subelement to subelement through at least two of the eight elements. The azimuthal angle of k in the perpendicular plane was oriented earthward and was oblique to that of the Poynting vector, which has implications for the validity of cold plasma theory.}

abstract = {Abstract A novel simulation grid is devised that is optimized for studying magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave coupling and phase mixing in a dipole-like magnetic field. The model also includes flaring on the dawn and dusk flanks. The location of the magnetopause is quite general. In particular, it does not have to coincide with a coordinate surface. Simulations indicate the central role of global fast waveguide modes. These switch from being azimuthally standing in nature at noon, to propagating antisunward on the flanks. The field line resonances (FLRs) seen in the simulation results are three dimensional and not strictly azimuthally polarized. When a plume is present, the FLRs cross a range of 2 in shell, and have a polarization that is midway between toroidal and poloidal.},

abstract = {Abstract We investigate the propagation of whistler mode waves near the local lower hybrid resonance (LHR) frequency in a dipole field with a two-dimensional full-wave model. First, we run a simulation in which a parallel whistler with frequency above the local LHR frequency is launched at the equatorial region in electron plasma. We find that whistler emission propagates along the dipole field line to a high latitude, turns quasi-electrostatic where the wave frequency is close to the local LHR frequency, and continues to propagate until being absorbed. Then, the proton response is considered. We find that (1) a quasi-electrostatic whistler reflects where the wave frequency is below the local LHR frequency and propagates to a larger L-shell and lower latitude, (2) a strong standing-wave pattern is formed in the LHR reflection region, and (3) the whistler emission turns from right-hand circularly polarized to linearly polarized near the reflection region. Finally, we run a simulation in which a quasi-electrostatic whistler is launched at a high latitude with a small-scale density irregularity added as a depletion to the background plasma. We find that a small portion of quasi-electrostatic whistler energy can be coupled to a parallel whistler, which can propagate to a much lower altitude while most of the wave energy experiences LHR reflection. Moreover, the mode coupling depends on the transverse and longitudinal sizes of the density irregularity. This makes a possible explanation of ground observations of nonducted whistler emission, which could have been reflected in the high-latitude ionosphere and magnetosphere.},

  abstract={Using measurements from the Cassini spacecraft in Saturn's magnetosphere, we propose a 3D physical picture of a corotating reconnection site, which can only be driven by an internally generated source. Our results demonstrate that the corotating magnetic reconnection can drive an expansion of the current sheet in Saturn�s magnetosphere and, consequently, can produce Fermi acceleration of electrons. This reconnection site lasted for longer than one of Saturn�s rotation period. The long-lasting and corotating natures of the magnetic reconnection site at Saturn suggest fundamentally different roles of magnetic reconnection in driving magnetospheric dynamics (e.g., the auroral precipitation) from the Earth. Our corotating reconnection picture could also potentially shed light on the fast rotating magnetized plasma environments in the solar system and beyond.}

  abstract={Kinetic Alfven waves (KAWs) are small-scale dispersive AWs that can play an important role in particle heating and acceleration of space and solar plasmas. An excitation mechanism for KAWs created by the coupling between large-scale oblique AWs and small-scale KAWs is presented in this paper. Taking into account both the collisional and Landau damping dissipations, the results show that the net growth rate of the excited KAWs increases with their perpendicular wavenumber k ? and reaches maximum at ? e k ? ~ 0.3, where ? e is the electron inertial length. However, for KAWs with shorter perpendicular wavelengths, the net growth rate decreases rapidly due to dissipative effects. The evaluation of the threshold amplitude of the AW implies that for KAWs with ? e k ? < 0.3, the relative threshold amplitude is well below 10%, which is easy to satisfy. In particular, when applying this mechanism to the case of a solar coronal hole containing a dense plume structure, our results show that KAWs with ? e k ? < 0.3 can be not only efficiently excited in the interplume region but also strongly dissipated in the dense plume due to the Landau damping.}

abstract = {Abstract Wave activities in tailward flows have been explored in the distant magnetotail at ~54 RE, where the coupling between whistler mode waves and ion scale waves was observed. The whistler mode waves periodically appeared at each cycle of the ion scale waves, and the electron distribution functions associated with the whistler mode waves showed enhancement in the direction parallel to background magnetic field. Wave analyses show that the field-aligned electron components act as the energy source of the whistler mode waves. The ion scale waves are generated by the interaction of the hot ion beam with background ions. A likely candidate of the ion scale wave is the kinetic Alfven wave, which can generate the enhanced field-aligned electron populations by the parallel electric field.}
