# Introduction

Juno Orbit

- Five-year cruise to Jupiter from 2011 to 2016
- One earth flyby in 2013
- Nearly the same Heliographic latitude as Earth

## Motivations

Studying the radial distribution of occurrence rate, as well as the properties of solar wind discontinuities may help answer the following questions:

- How does the discontinuities change with the radial distance from the Sun?

- How is solar wind discontinuities formed? What is the physical mechanisms?

  - Generated at or near the sun?

  - Locally generated in the interplanetary space by turbulence?

Joint observations of JUNO & ARTEMIS & Other missions really provides a unique opportunity!!!

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYp5p2oL51g title='Juno spacecraft trajectory animation' >}}

To eliminate the effect of the solar wind structure, we use data from other missions (mainly at 1AU) to provide a way of normalization.

# Conclusion

- The normalized occurrence rate of interplanetary discontinuities (IDs) decreases with radial distance from the Sun, following a $1/r$ relationship.

- The thickness of IDs increases with radial distance, but when normalized to the ion inertial length, the thickness decreases.

- The current density of IDs decreases with radial distance, but when normalized to the Alfvén current, the current density of IDs increases.

- The distribution of the normalized thickness and current density of IDs remain constant over time at 1 AU on a yearly scale.
