-   @sodingRadialLatitudinalDependencies2001 studied the radial distribution of discontinuities in the solar wind between 0.3 and 19 AU during solar activity minimum.
-   @liuCharacteristicsInterplanetaryDiscontinuities2021 studied the spatial evolution of the discontinuities from 0.13-0.9 AU, using measurements from the Parker Solar Probe.

The orange curves in panels (c) and (d) are the power-function fittings of ID and RD occurrence rates, with the coefficient of determination R2 being 0.983 and 0.985, respectively. The uncertainties of the power-law indices correspond to 95% confidence bounds."}
