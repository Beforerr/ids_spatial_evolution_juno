## Introduction

"Discontinuous changes in plasmas parameters and magnetic fields"

![Examples of IDs from Juno, ARTEMIS, STEREO, and Wind](../figures/fig_examples.png){#fig-examples}

## Motivation

**How do solar wind discontinuities evolve over radial distances from the Sun?**

Juno during its five-year cruise phase (2011-2016) to Jupiter provides a unique opportunity!

=> **What are the physical mechanisms behind their formation and evolution?**

<!-- However, previous study of solar wind discontinuities evolution [@sodingRadialLatitudinalDependencies2001] in the outer heliosphere were rarely in conjunction with measurements closer to the Sun. Moreover, the intervals in their study spread over multiple solar cycles though they are selected during solar activity minimum. Thus it is presently unclear whether their frequency and properties are the result of solar variability or due to the natural evolution of the discontinuities during their propagation and interaction with the ambient solar wind. -->

## Overview

::: {#fig-overview}

![](../figures/fig_overview.png)

Overview. **a,** Juno's orbit during its cruise phase (2011-2016). **b,** Difference in heliographic longitude between Juno and 1-AU missions. **c,** monthly and smoothed sunspot numbers. **d-g,** solar wind plasma density and speed from Near-Earth (OMNI) and STEREO-A missions.

:::

::: {.notes}
During the initial phase of the JUNO mission, the sunspot number reached its peak, indicating a period of heightened solar activity. However, by the end of the mission's cruise phase, there was a significant decline in solar activity. This variation underscores the importance of calibrating the discontinuity properties in relation to solar activity levels to account for temporal fluctuations.

::: {.notes}
The change in the current density could be explained by the change in the solar wind properties with the solar cycle, as shown in @fig-swParameters. Density and magnetic field asscoiated with the discontinuities increases with the solar cycle approaching the solar minimum, which could lead to the increase of the current density of the discontinuities with fixed normalized current density.

::: {.notes}
However, since Juno does not provide direct plasma measurements, we will estimate the spatial scale (thickness) of discontinuities using solar wind speed derived from solar wind propagation models. Specifically, we will employ the Two-Dimensional Outer Heliosphere Solar Wind Modeling (MSWIM2D) [@keeblerMSWIM2DTwodimensionalOuter2022] to determine the ion bulk velocity ($v$) and plasma density ($n$) at Juno’s location. This model, which utilizes the BATSRUS MHD solver, simulates the propagation of solar wind from 1 to 75 astronomical units (AU) in the ecliptic plane, effectively covering the region pertinent to our study. The MSWIM2D model provides output data with an hourly time resolution as shown in @fig-model. The comparison of magnetic field magnitudes from MSWIM2D with those measured by Juno, after averaging to the same time resolution, reveals a strong correlation, confirming the model’s reliability.

## Results - Occurrence rate

::: {#fig-rate}

![](../figures/ocr/ocr_time_cleaned.png)

The number of discontinuities measured by Juno per day coincides with the discontinuity number measured by STEREO, WIND, and ARTEMIS, when Juno is around $1$ AU. This number (occurrence rate) decreases with distance (with time after $\sim 2013$), as Juno moves from $1$ AU to $5$ AU.

## Conclusion

- The normalized occurrence rate of interplanetary discontinuities (IDs) decreases with radial distance from the Sun, following a $1/r$ relationship.

- The thickness of IDs increases with radial distance, but when normalized to the ion inertial length, it decreases.

- The current density of IDs decreases with radial distance, but when normalized to the Alfvén current, it increases.

- The distribution of the normalized thickness and current density of IDs remain constant over time at 1 AU on a yearly scale.
