# Data

`events_method=fit_name=JNO_tau=0:01:00_ts=0:00:01.arrow` and `events.JNO.fit.ts_1.00s_tau_60s.arrow` are the same data for backward compatibility.

## Solar Wind Model

Sadly, JUNO does not provide plasma data during the cruise phase, so to estimate the plasma state we will use MHD model.

We are using [Michigan Solar WInd Model 2D (MSWIM2D)](http://csem.engin.umich.edu/MSWIM2D/), which models the solar wind propagation in 2D using the BATSRUS MHD solver. @keeblerMSWIM2DTwodimensionalOuter2022

Some key points about the model

-   Representing the solar wind in the ecliptic plane from 1 to 75 AU
-   2D MHD model, using the BATSRUS MHD solver
-   Inclusion of neutral hydrogen (important for the outer heliosphere)
-   Inner boundary is filled by time-shifting in situ data from multiple spacecraft

For model validation part, please see [JUNO Model Report](notebooks/20_model.ipynb).
