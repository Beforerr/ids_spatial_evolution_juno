  abstract =      {The nonuniform emission of the solar wind from the
                   sun means that conditions are established which favor
                   the development of discontinuities in the plasma
                   parameters. Since the solar wind is in rapid proper
                   motion with respect to the sun and the earth,
                   examination of these discontinuities requires that
                   the wind velocity be transformed away. Then it is
                   found that they satisfy the conditions of
                   magnetohydrodynamics and can be treated as shock
                   waves and the stationary contact surfaces consisting
                   of either tangential or contact discontinuities. The
                   collision-free structure of the solar wind suggests
                   that the tangential discontinuity is the more likely
                   contact surface as it is more capable of inhibiting
                   diffusion which is required for a lifetime sufficient
                   for the structure to be carried to the neighborhood
                   of the earth.},

  abstract =      {The interplanetary discontinuities (IDs) have been
                   widely observed in astrophysical and space plasmas,
                   while their characteristics and evolutions within 0.3
                   AU are still unclear due to the limitation of
                   spacecraft orbits in previous missions. Here, we
                   report three ID events, including a rotational
                   discontinuity (RD), a tangential discontinuity (TD),
                   and a suspected contact discontinuity (CD), detected
                   by the Parker Solar Probe in a previously unexplored
                   region of the heliosphere as close to the Sun as 0.13
                   AU. By the combination of the minimum variance
                   analysis technique, the Wal{\'e}n relation and the
                   continuity condition of the electric field, the ID
                   orientations, propagations, and thicknesses are
                   determined, showing a smaller typical ID thickness on
                   the order of 100 km therein. Automated event
                   selection using a magnetic field change threshold
                   criterion is conducted with the PSP field data on
                   Orbits 4 and 5. In total, 3,948 IDs are collected,
                   yielding a ratio of . The IDs within 0.4 AU account
                   for 87\% of the total IDs, resulting in sharp ID
                   occurrence rate decrease with heliocentric distance,
                   from {$\sim$}140 days-1 for RDs and {$\sim$}8 days-1
                   for TDs at 0.13 AU to about 1 day-1 for both RDs and
                   TDs at r {$>$} 0.6 AU. Within 0.3 AU, the RDs with
                   tiny propagation angles, i.e., the angles between the
                   magnetic fields and the RD normals, predominate in
                   all kinds of IDs. We further analyze the jump
                   conditions of these IDs statistically, and find that
                   the changes in magnetic fields and particle
                   parameters are theoretically consistent.},

                   1 to 331, 2009, which were obtained deep in the
                   heliosheath between 108.5 and 111.8 AU. Three types
                   of current sheets were found: (1) 15 proton boundary
                   layers (PBLs), (2) 10 and 3 magnetic holes and
                   magnetic humps, respectively, and (3) 3 sector
                   boundaries. The magnetic field strength changes
                   across PBL, and the profile B(t) is linearly related
                   to the hyperbolic tangent function, but the direction
                   of B does not change. For each of the three sector
                   boundaries, B rotated in a plane normal to the
                   minimum variance direction, and the component of B
                   along the minimum variance direction was zero within
                   the uncertainties, indicating that the sector
                   boundaries were tangential discontinuities. The
                   structure of the sector boundaries was not as simple
                   as that for PBLs. The average thickness of magnetic
                   holes and humps ({$\sim$}30 RL) was twice that of the
                   PBLs ({$\sim$}15 RL). The average thickness of the
                   current sheets associated with sector boundaries was
                   close to the thickness of the PBLs. Our observations
                   are consistent with the hypothesis that magnetic
                   holes and humps are solitons, which are initiated by
                   the mirror mode instability, and evolve by nonlinear
                   kinetic plasma processes to pressure balanced
                   structures maintained by magnetization currents and
                   proton drift currents in the gradients of B.},

                   of the profile, and illustrate the behavior of

                   compared with the power spectral density of the
                   solar-wind magnetic field. The strong discontinuities
                   produce a power-law spectrum in the ``inertial
                   subrange'' with a spectral index near the Kolmogorov
                   -5/3 index. The discontinuity spectrum contains about
                   half of the power of the full solar-wind magnetic
                   field over this ``inertial subrange.'' Warnings are
                   issued about the significant contribution of
                   discontinuities to the spectrum of the solar wind,
                   complicating interpretation of spectral power and
                   spectral indices.},

                   effects are reviewed for magnetospheric/space weather
                   researchers. Discontinuities are particularly useful
                   as diagnostics since they are clearly identifiable in
                   interplanetary data and their geomagnetic effects are
                   unambiguous most of the time. Directional
                   discontinuities (DDs) are abrupt changes in the
                   interplanetary magnetic field direction and plasma
                   parameters. DDs may be rotational discontinuities
                   (RDs), tangential discontinuities (TDs) contact
                   discontinuities (CDs) or shocks (fast (FS),
                   intermediate (IS) and slow (SS). Shocks can propagate
                   in the direction of the driver (forward shocks or
                   FSs) or opposite to the driver (reverse shocks of
                   RSs). Discontinuities interacting with other
                   discontinuities may create new discontinuities. Fast
                   forward shocks (FFSs) are shown to energize trapped
                   particles by compressive effects, cause dayside
                   aurora, lead to the creation of new radiation belts
                   and to trigger nightside sector magnetospheric
                   substorms. Fast reverse shocks (FRSs) or reverse
                   waves (RWs) lead to magnetospheric expansions and the
                   cessation of geomagnetic activity. TD-bow shock
                   interactions create hot flow anomalies (HFAs) which
                   then lead to outward expansions of the local
                   magnetopause and dayside auroral enhancements. Some
                   DD crossings may cause sudden southward IMF turnings.
                   These cause magnetic reconnection and energy input
                   into the magnetosphere--ionosphere--magnetotail
                   system. Substorms sometimes occur thereafter. DDs
                   that entail northward IMF turnings may lead to the
                   triggering of substorms.},

                   -80{$^\circ$} and +10{$^\circ$} in the 3D heliosphere
                   are investigated during minimum solar activity. The
                   data are surveyed using the identification criteria
                   of Burlaga (1969) (B) and Tsurutani and Smith (1979)
                   (TS). The rate of occurrence depends linearly on the
                   solar wind velocity caused by the geometric effect of
                   investigating a larger plasma volume if the solar
                   wind velocity \&\#x03BD;sw increases. The radial
                   dependence is proportional to r--0.78 (TS criterion)
                   and r--1.28 (B criterion), respectively. This
                   dependence is not only due to an increasing miss rate
                   with increasing distance. The DDs must be unstable or
                   some other physical effect must exist. After
                   normalization of the daily rates to 400 km/s and 1
                   AU, no dependence on heliographic latitude or on
                   solar wind structures is observable. This means that
                   the DDs are uniformly distributed on a spherical
                   shell. Normalized 64 DD per day are identified with
                   both criteria. But large variations of the daily rate
                   still occur, indicating that other influences must
                   exist. The ratio of the rates of rotational (RDs) and
                   tangential discontinuities (TDs) depends on the solar
                   wind structures. In high speed streams, relatively
                   more RDs exist than in low speed streams. In the
                   inner heliosphere (r \&lt; 10 AU), no radial or
                   latitudinal dependence of the portions of the DD
                   types occur. 55\% clear RDs, 10\% clear TDs and 33\%
                   EDs (either discontinuities) are observed, but the
                   portions differ with regard to the criteria used. In
                   the middle heliosphere (10 AU\&lt; r \&lt; 40 AU),
                   the DD types are more uniformly distributed. The
                   distribution of the directional change \&\#x03C9;
                   over the transition evolves to an increase of smaller
                   \&\#x03C9; with increasing distance from the sun. The
                   evolution is yielded by the anisotropic RDs with
                   small \&\#x03C9;. The spatial thickness dkm in
                   kilometers increases with distance. The thickness drg
                   normalized to the proton gyro radius decreases by a
                   factor of 50 between 0.3 and 19 AU, from 201.3 rg
                   down to 4.3 rg. In the middle heliosphere, the
                   orientation of the normals relative to the local
                   magnetic field is essentially uniform except for the
                   parallel direction where no DDs occur. This indicates
                   that RDs propagating parallel to B play a special
                   role. In addition, in only a few cases is
                   [\&\#x03C5;] parallel to [B / \&\#x03C1;], which is
                   required by the MHD theory for RDs. The DDs have
                   strongly enhanced values of proton gyro radius rg for
                   \&\#x03C9; {\textasciitilde} 90{$^\circ$}. In
                   contrast, in the inner heliosphere, only a small

                   characterizes Jupiter's planetary magnetic field and
                   magnetosphere, providing the first globally
                   distributed and proximate measurements of the
                   magnetic field of Jupiter. The magnetic field
                   instrumentation consists of two independent
                   magnetometer sensor suites, each consisting of a
                   tri-axial Fluxgate Magnetometer (FGM) sensor and a
                   pair of co-located imaging sensors mounted on an
                   ultra-stable optical bench. The imaging system
                   sensors are part of a subsystem that provides
                   accurate attitude information (to {$\sim$}20 arcsec
                   on a spinning spacecraft) near the point of
                   measurement of the magnetic field. The two sensor
                   suites are accommodated at 10 and 12 m from the body
                   of the spacecraft on a 4 m long magnetometer boom
                   affixed to the outer end of one of 's three solar
                   array assemblies. The magnetometer sensors are
                   controlled by independent and functionally identical
                   electronics boards within the magnetometer
                   electronics package mounted inside Juno's massive
                   radiation shielded vault. The imaging sensors are
                   controlled by a fully hardware redundant electronics
                   package also mounted within the radiation vault. Each
                   magnetometer sensor measures the vector magnetic
                   field with 100 ppm absolute vector accuracy over a
                   wide dynamic range (to 16 Gauss = \$1.6
                   {\textbackslash}times
                   10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}{\textbackslash}mbox\{
                   nT\}\$per axis) with a resolution of {$\sim$}0.05 nT
                   in the most sensitive dynamic range ({\textpm}1600~nT
                   per axis). Both magnetometers sample the magnetic
                   field simultaneously at an intrinsic sample rate of
                   64 vector samples per second. The magnetic field
                   instrumentation may be reconfigured in flight to meet
                   unanticipated needs and is fully hardware redundant.
                   The attitude determination system compares images
                   with an on-board star catalog to provide attitude
                   solutions (quaternions) at a rate of up
                   to~4~solutions per second, and may be configured to
                   acquire images of selected targets for science and
                   engineering analysis. The system tracks and catalogs
                   objects that pass through the imager field of view
                   and also provides a continuous record of radiation
                   exposure. A spacecraft magnetic control program was
                   implemented to provide a magnetically clean
                   environment for the magnetic sensors, and residual
                   spacecraft fields and/or sensor offsets are monitored
                   in flight taking advantage of Juno's spin (nominally
                   2~rpm) to separate environmental fields from those
                   that rotate with the spacecraft.},

                   Probe (PSP) in 2018, followed by Solar Orbiter (SO)
                   in February 2020, has opened a new window in the
                   exploration of solar magnetic activity and the origin
                   of the heliosphere. These missions, together with
                   other space observatories dedicated to solar
                   observations, such as the Solar Dynamics Observatory,
                   Hinode, IRIS, STEREO, and SOHO, with complementary in
                   situ observations from WIND and ACE, and ground based
                   multi-wavelength observations including the DKIST
                   observatory that has just seen first light, promise
                   to revolutionize our understanding of the solar
                   atmosphere and of solar activity, from the generation
                   and emergence of the Sun's magnetic field to the
                   creation of the solar wind and the acceleration of
                   solar energetic particles.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$}
                   Here we describe the scientific objectives of the PSP
                   and SO missions, and highlight the potential for
                   discovery arising from synergistic observations. Here
                   we put particular emphasis on how the combined remote
                   sensing and in situ observations of SO, that bracket
                   the outer coronal and inner heliospheric observations
                   by PSP, may provide a reconstruction of the solar
                   wind and magnetic field expansion from the Sun out to
                   beyond the orbit of Mercury in the first phases of
                   the mission. In the later, out-of-ecliptic portions
                   of the SO mission, the solar surface magnetic field
                   measurements from SO and the multi-point white-light
                   observations from both PSP and SO will shed light on
                   the dynamic, intermittent solar wind escaping from
                   helmet streamers, pseudo-streamers, and the confined
                   coronal plasma, and on solar energetic particle
                   transport.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} Joint
                   measurements during PSP--SO alignments, and magnetic
                   connections along the same flux tube complemented by
                   alignments with Earth, dual PSP--Earth, and SO-Earth,
                   as well as with STEREO-A, SOHO, and BepiColumbo will
                   allow a better understanding of the in situ evolution
                   of solar-wind plasma flows and the full
                   three-dimensional distribution of the solar wind from
                   a purely observational point of view. Spectroscopic
                   observations of the corona, and optical and radio
                   observations, combined with direct in situ
                   observations of the accelerating solar wind will
                   provide a new foundation for understanding the
                   fundamental physical processes leading to the energy
                   transformations from solar photospheric flows and
                   magnetic fields into the hot coronal plasma and

                   energy of the solar wind and solar energetic
                   particles.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We discuss the
                   initial PSP observations, which already provide a
                   compelling rationale for new measurement campaigns by

  abstract =      {The vast size of the Sun's heliosphere, combined with
                   sparse spacecraft measurements over that large
                   domain, makes numerical modeling a critical tool to
                   predict solar wind conditions where there are no
                   measurements. This study models the solar wind
                   propagation in 2D using the BATSRUS MHD solver to
                   form the MSWIM2D data set of solar wind in the outer
                   heliosphere. Representing the solar wind from 1 to 75
                   au in the ecliptic plane, a continuous model run from
                   1995--present has been performed. The results are
                   available for free at
                   http://csem.engin.umich.edu/mswim2d/. The web
                   interface extracts output at desired locations and
                   times. In addition to solar wind ions, the model
                   includes neutrals coming from the interstellar medium
                   to reproduce the slowing of the solar wind in the
                   outer heliosphere and to extend the utility of the
                   model to larger radial distances. The inclusion of
                   neutral hydrogen is critical to recreating the solar
                   wind accurately outside of {$\sim$}4 au. The inner
                   boundary is filled by interpolating and time-shifting
                   in situ observations from L1 and STEREO spacecraft
                   when available. Using multiple spacecraft provides a
                   more accurate boundary condition than a single
                   spacecraft with time shifting alone. Validations of
                   MSWIM2D are performed using MAVEN and New Horizons
                   observations. The results demonstrate the efficacy of
                   this model to propagate the solar wind to large
                   distances and obtain practical, useful solar wind
                   predictions. For example, the rms error of solar wind
                   speed prediction at Mars is only 66 km s-1 and at
                   Pluto is a mere 25 km s-1.},

                   by utilizing 14 months of Magnetospheric Multiscale
                   mission data. 117,669 IDs are collected, including
                   108,049 events in the solar wind and 6399 events in
                   the magnetosheath, with the remnant in the
                   magnetosphere or near the bow shock/magnetopause. We
                   find the following: (1) the ID occurrence rate is
                   17.0 events hr-1 in the solar wind and 5.5 events
                   hr-1 in the magnetosheath, (2) the field rotation
                   angles during ID crossings in the magnetosheath
                   exhibit a two-exponential distribution with a
                   breakpoint at 50{$^\circ$}, which is not observed for
                   IDs in the solar wind, (3) the magnetosheath IDs with
                   small field rotation angles tend to be clustered, (4)
                   by classifying the IDs into rotational
                   discontinuities (RDs), tangential discontinuities
                   (TDs), either TDs or RDs (EDs), and neither TDs nor
                   RDs (NDs), we estimate RD:TD:ED:ND =
                   68\%:5\%:20\%:7\% in the solar wind, and RD:TD:ED:ND
                   = 15\%:44\%:18\%:23\% in the magnetosheath, (5) the
                   occurrence rates of RDs and TDs are, respectively
                   7.95 and 0.58 events hr-1 in the solar wind, and 0.57
                   and 1.60 events hr-1 in the magnetosheath, (6) RDs
                   are more likely to propagate antisunward in the
                   plasma rest frame, especially in the magnetosheath,
                   and (7) the average thicknesses of the RDs and TDs
                   are estimated, respectively, as 10.4 and 8.1 proton
                   gyroradii (r p ) in the solar wind, and 17.4 and 5.0
                   r p in the magnetosheath. This work can improve our
                   understanding of IDs' interaction with the

                   magnetopause penetration can be used to determine the
                   vector normal to the magnetopause current layer and
                   the magnetic-field component along this normal.
                   According to theory such a component is a measure of
                   the amount of field reconnection at magnetopause.
                   Results from 22 Explorer 12 boundary penetrations are
                   presented indicating normal-field components of less
                   than 5 {$\gamma$} in two-thirds of the cases.
                   Measured field variations within the current layer
                   are presented to demonstrate the existence of two
                   fundamentally different types of boundary structure,
                   the rotational and the tangential discontinuity. The
                   former of these permits a nonzero normal field
                   component, whereas the latter does not. The
                   rotational discontinuity seems to occur predominantly
                   during magnetic storms and two of these cases,
                   involving substantial normal-field components,
                   provide compelling evidence that field reconnection
                   takes place during the storm main phase. Finally, the
                   calculated normal vector is compared with the normal
                   to the surface of the Mead-Beard magnetosphere
