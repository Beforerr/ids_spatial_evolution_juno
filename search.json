    "text": "Main findings\n\nSolar wind discontinuities evolve in space with occurrence rate decreasing, thickness increasing and current density decreasing with distance from the Sun. And they are probably generated locally beyond 1 AU.\nBackground sheared magnetic field plays an important role in determining the efficiency of ion pitch angle scattering, and characterize three ion populations: transient, trapped, regular.",
