I identified and analyzed the properties of the discontinuities at different radial distances from the Sun. I differentiated the temporal effect (correlated with solar activity) and spatial variations (correlated with radial distance).\nWhat I found: The normalized occurrence rate of IDs drops with the radial distance from the Sun, following a \\(1/r\\) law. The thickness of IDs increases with the radial distance from the Sun, but after normalization to the ion inertial length, the thickness of IDs decreases. The current intensity of IDs decreases with the radial distance from the Sun, but after normalization to the Alfven current, the current intensity of IDs increases.\nWhat it means: The results of this study provide a better understanding of the solar wind discontinuities in the outer heliosphere and their spatial evolution.

    "text": "Dataset\nIn this study we use datasets of four missions measuring solar wind magnetic field and plasma. Synergistic observations of these missions should advance our understanding of the solar wind discontinuities, their radial distribution and evolution (Velli et al. 2020).\n\nThe solar wind plasma state, as evidenced by the sunspot number (referenced in Figure 1), plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of discontinuities. During the initial phase of the JUNO mission, the sunspot number reached its peak, indicating a period of heightened solar activity. However, by the end of the mission’s cruise phase, there was a significant decline in solar activity. This variation underscores the importance of calibrating the discontinuity properties in relation to solar activity levels to account for temporal fluctuations.\nFurthermore, an analysis of Figure 1 reveals the significance of the heliographic longitudinal difference between the Juno mission and Near-Earth missions (such as Wind and ARTEMIS) as well as STEREO-A missions. This longitudinal discrepancy ensures comprehensive coverage of the plasma en route to Juno. Specifically, when there is a substantial longitudinal difference between Juno and Earth, the difference between Juno and STEREO-A tends to be minimal, and vice versa. This relationship facilitates an extensive observation network for the plasma traveling towards Juno.\nThe time resolution of the magnetic field and plasma data for Juno, Wind, ARTEMIS, STEREO is summarized in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Missions info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMission\n\\(\\delta t_B\\)\n\\(\\delta t_{plasma}\\)\nRadial coverage\nLaunch date\nwebsite\n\n\n\n\nJuno\n1 Hz\n\n1 - 5.5 AU\n2011-08-05 00:00:00\n[‘NASA’]\n\n\nARTEMIS\n5 Hz, …\n\n\n2007-02-17 00:00:00\n\n\n\nSTEREO-A\n8 Hz\n\n\n2006-10-26 00:00:00\n\n\n\nWIND\n11 Hz\n\n\n1994-11-01 00:00:00\n[‘NASA’]\n\n\nSolar Orbiter\n\n\n0.28 - 0.9 AU\n2020-02-10 00:00:00\n[‘ESA’]\n\n\nParker Solar Probe\n\n\n0.05 - 1 AU\n2018-08-12 00:00:00\n[‘NASA’]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Notes",

    "text": "Methods\nWe use Liu’s (Liu, Fu, Cao, Wang, et al. 2022) method to identify discontinuities in the solar wind. This method has better compatibility for the discontinuities with minor field changes, and is more robust to the situation encountered in the outer heliosphere. For each sampling instant \\(t\\), we define three intervals: the pre-interval \\([-1,-1/2]\\cdot T+t\\), the middle interval \\([-1/,1/2]\\cdot T+t\\), and the post-interval \\([1/2,1]\\cdot T+t\\), in which \\(T\\) are time lags. Let time series of the magnetic field data in these three intervals are labeled \\({\\mathbf B}_-\\), \\({\\mathbf B}_0\\), \\({\\mathbf B}_+\\), respectively. Then for an discontinuity, the following three conditions should be satisfied: (1) \\(\\sigma({\\mathbf B}_0) &gt; 2\\max\\left(\\sigma({\\mathbf B}_-), \\sigma({\\mathbf B}_+)\\right)\\), (2) \\(\\sigma\\left({\\mathbf B}_-+{\\mathbf B}_+\\right)&gt;\\sigma({\\mathbf B}_-)+\\sigma({\\mathbf B}_+)\\), and (3) \\(|\\Delta {\\mathbf B}|&gt;|{\\mathbf B}_{bg}|/10\\), in which \\(\\sigma\\) and \\({\\mathbf B}_{bg}\\) represent the standard deviation and the background magnetic field magnitude, and \\(\\Delta {\\mathbf B}={\\mathbf B}(t+T/2)-{\\mathbf B}(t-T/2)\\). The first two conditions guarantee that the field changes of the discontinuity identified are large enough to be distinguished from the stochastic fluctuations or Alfven waves on magnetic fields, while the third is a supplementary condition to reduce the uncertainty of recognition.\nThen for each discontinuity identified, we calculate the distance matrix of the time series sequence (distance between each pair of magnetic field vectors) to determine the leading edge and trailing edge of the discontinuity. After that, we use the minimum or maximum variance analysis (MVA) analysis (Bengt U. Ö. Sonnerup and Scheible 1998; B. U. Ö. Sonnerup and Cahill Jr. 1967) to get the main (most varying) magnetic field component, \\(B_l\\), and medium variation component, \\(B_m\\). The maxium variance direction is then fitted by a step-like functions to extract the parameters to properly describe the discontinuity (we used logistic function here). Then we combine the magnetic field data and plasma data to obtain the thickness and the current density of the discontinuity.\n\\[\nB(t; A, \\mu, \\sigma, {\\mathrm{form=logistic}}) = A \\left[1 - \\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\alpha}} \\right]\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha = (t - \\mu)/{\\sigma}\\).\nFigure 3 shows several examples of solar wind discontinuities detected by different spacecraft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Examples of IDs from ARTEMIS, STEREO, and Wind",

(The data is obtained from OMNIWEB, link: omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftpbrowser/themis_b_sw.txt)\nThe rate of occurrence depends linearly on the solar wind velocity (Söding et al. 2001), however the plasma velocity data in Juno mission is not available during its cruise phase. Therefore, we do not normalize the occurrence rate with respect to the solar wind speed. This influence of the solar wind speed on the occurrence rate might be mitigated by the fact all the spacecrafts are in the ecliptic plane, and the solar wind speed is not expected to change significantly with the radial distance from the Sun beyond \\(1\\) AU. So the decrease of the occurrence rate with the radial distance from the Sun is expected to be a real effect of the radial distance from the Sun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The number of discontinuities measured by Juno per day coincides with the discontinuity number measured by STEREO, WIND, and ARTEMIS, when Juno is around \\(1\\) AU.
